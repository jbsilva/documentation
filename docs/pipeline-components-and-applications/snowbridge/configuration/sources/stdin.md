# Stdin Source

Stdin source is the default, and has one optional configuration to set the concurrency. 

Stdin source simply treats stdin as the input.

## Configuration 

Here is an example of the minimum required configuration:

```hcl reference
https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/stream-replicator-examples-temp/blob/main/docs/docs/documentation-examples/configuration/sources/stdin-minimal-example.hcl
```

Here is an example of every configuration option:

```hcl reference
https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/stream-replicator-examples-temp/blob/main/docs/docs/documentation-examples/configuration/sources/stdin-full-example.hcl
```
